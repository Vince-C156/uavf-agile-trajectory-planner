# UAVF Agile Trajectory Planner

## Overview
The UAVF Agile Trajectory Planner is a specialized tool designed to optimize drone flight paths dynamically for high performance and agility. Utilizing the Control Performance Coefficient (CPC) trajectory optimization methodology developed by the University of Zurich (UZH), this planner is tailored for competitive scenarios like the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) competition. By integrating with PyDrake, the planner offers a robust, flexible simulation environment for testing and validating complex flight maneuvers.

## Features
- **CPC Trajectory Optimization**: Leverages cutting-edge research to calculate efficient, agile trajectories.
- **Waypoint Navigation**: Allows precise control over the drone's path by specifying waypoints for the drone to follow.
- **PyDrake Integration**: Utilizes the powerful PyDrake framework for accurate simulation and analysis.
- **SUAS Competition Focus**: Tailored to meet the dynamic and challenging requirements of SUAS competitions.
